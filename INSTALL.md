# code4rice3K Installation and Setup

## Obtaining code4rice3K

Presumably you are reading this file on our github site and thus you are
likely to know that the following commands on your local machine should get
you going:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrendelGroup/code4rice3K
cd code4rice3K/
```

That said, an implicit assumption is that your local machine runs some version
of Linux.
